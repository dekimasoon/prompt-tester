# What is Prompt Tester

Prompt Tester is a tool that helps to make the verification of prompts for LLMs easier to perform with a GUI. The following features are implemented to make verification more convenient

- Variables: Variables can be defined by using `{{}}` in the prompt
- Multi-case execution: You can set multiple values for variables and call LLM at the same time.
- Version Control: The results of LLM calls are automatically saved, allowing for easy version control of prompts.

See a [demo](https://prompt-tester-dekimasoon.vercel.app/).

Prompt Tester is still in its alpha version, and while it is minimally available, it still has some features that are not yet implemented, and the UI is not yet refined.
If you have any suggestions for improvements, please submit a PR or write an Issue.
