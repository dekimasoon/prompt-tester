# What is Prompt Tester

Prompt Tester is a tool that makes it easy to verify prompts for LLMs with a GUI. The following features are implemented to make verification more convenient

- Variables: Variables can be defined using `{{}}` in a prompt.
- Multi-case execution: You can set multiple values for variables and call LLM at the same time.
- CSV download: Execution results can be downloaded together as a CSV.
- Version control: The results of LLM executions are automatically saved, facilitating version control of the prompt.
